## 10 October 2025 — Reflection & Direction Shift

### What I Did
- Finished **Issue #1**: printed `"Corner Clash starting..."` to confirm the setup works.
- Started **Issue #2**: attempted to render a 2×2 ASCII grid.

### What I Realised
I struggled to break the grid problem into smaller steps and I’m not yet confident with Python syntax (loops, functions, returns). I understand the idea but get stuck expressing it in code.

### Decision
Pause *Corner Clash* feature work and complete Angela Yu’s **100 Days of Python** as a structured bootcamp. I’ll log how each day maps back to this project in `docs/learning-log.md`.

### Next Steps
- Create repo: `python-100-days-training`
- Add daily notes and link them from this repo
- Resume *Corner Clash* after core Python fundamentals (around Day 20–25)

### Reflection
This isn’t quitting; it’s sharpening fundamentals so I can return and build confidently like a software engineer.
